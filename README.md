# Stock-Market-scrapping
This program extracted stock data about all companies that were publicly traded on NYSE and IEX. This program is written in C++ and all the data was pulled from IEX CLOUD 1.0. As of 2020 this program no longer works because the version of IEX API that I used at the time is now deprecated. The Stock data was stored in apropiate named classes and website calls were made multithreaded
